# Question
What kind of front end projects do you enjoy working on? Why?

# Answer

Two things are important for me:

1. I like projects with intricated business logic. Technical challenges usually are more or less similar everywhere regardless the company. The more interesting to understand the problem and challenges of the business itself.   
2. However, building dev-to-dev things is also interesting. I like to work on libraries, tools, and internal frameworks. It's interesting to see how other developers use your work and how it helps them to solve their problems.
