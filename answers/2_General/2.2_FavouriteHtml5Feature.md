# Question
Which are your favorite features of HTML5? How have you used them before?

# Answer

### Top 1
My top 1 favorite feature of HTML5 is [Picture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) tag.

It's the most frequently used feature for me. It's a great way to solve the main pain with **Core web vitals** - images optimization.
Usually images affect **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), FID (First Input Delay)**.

And thanks to Picture tage we receive out of the box:
- different images for different screen sizes
- usage of **WebP** format for modern browsers
- safe fallback image for old browsers

### Top 2

Semantic tags and other accessibility features are the second most used feature for me.

These days accessible applications are a must-have.  

### Other

Other features that I'm glad to have out of the box, but I don't use them so often:
- drag and drop
- web sockets
