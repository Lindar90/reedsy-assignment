# Question
Explain the difference between creating a DOM element setting innerHTML and using createElement

# Answer
**Personal note:** I try to stick to `createElement` whenever it's possible.

### innerHTML
#### Pros
- allows to create: 
  - multiple sibling DOM elements at once 
  - nested tree of elements
- simplicity of use via direct string assignment

#### Cons
- less efficient, as browser needs to parse and build the DOM tree
- might be arrow-prone due to errors in the HTML string
- open for XSS attacks

### createElement
#### Pros
- more efficient, as it doesn't require parsing
- less error-prone, as we are creating an element via explicit API
- secure

#### Cons
- more verbose, adds more boilerplate code
- allows to create only one element at a time
