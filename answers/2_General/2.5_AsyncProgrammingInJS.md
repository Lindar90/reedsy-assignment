# Question

Why is asynchronous programming important in JavaScript?

# Answer

This is a big topic that touches many JS aspects:
- event loop
- single-threaded nature of JS
- non-blocking I/O
- call stack
- callback queue
- micro and macro tasks

How it works:
1. all JS engines are single-threaded
2. it means that they can execute only one thing at a time
3. first of all, JS engine executes the code from the call stack. I.e all synchronous operations
4. if there is an async operation, it will be moved to the callback queue
5. when the call stack is empty, the event loop will move the first thing from the callback queue to the call stack
6. and so on

What is important:
1. it allows to write non-blocking code
2. waiting of all async operations (network requests, timers, user interactions etc) doesn't block the main thread
3. Items in a queue might have different priorities (micro and macro tasks).
   1. Micro tasks have high priority. For instance, promises.
   2. Macro tasks have low priority. For instance, setTimeout, setInterval.
