# Question

Tell us about one of your commercial projects with Vue.js.

# Answer

I have 5+ years of commercial experience with Vuejs. 

I had a chance to use it projects with different scales.

Two the most noticeable projects are:

### Upwork

A big product with 100+ microfrontends using Nuxt.js 2.

While working on this project, I was responsible for the following:
- Launched 7 experiments during 1 year in Experiment Labs team.
- First adopted new experimental Micro app architecture, battle tested it and improved the architecture, what lead to reducing of the amount of
deployments (from 8 repositories to 1), and reduced the feature delivery time
from 2 weeks to 1 hour.
- Increased Unit tests code-coverage by 90% in my projects.
- Adopted Cypress E2E testing in our team.
- Developed the frontend for a new signup flow within weeks of starting.
- Collaborated with the eng lead to drive the success of multiple epic projects.
- Developed a couple of reusable component libraries.

### Shapediver

A small project compared to Upwork, but it was a great experience:
- I joined the project as a team lead to develop a new greenfield version of the product from scratch and build the team.
- It involved choice of the technology stack (**Nuxt 2 with composition API, Typescript** etc), architectural decisions, design system, development of all core features, setting of tests infrastructure etc.
- I rebuild their marketing website on a new stack:  **Nuxtjs, TailwindCss and headless Storyblok CMS.**
